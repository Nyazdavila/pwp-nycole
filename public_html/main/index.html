      <p class="intoTextPara1 pt-3">Nycole originally designed her career between art and finance. The collision of the two worlds began in college. She attended college in Seattle, WA. for a degree in Animation Arts and Design, while maintaining a full time career at the local credit union. Upon completion of her degree, Nycole returned home to Albuquerque, NM, where she continued her career in finance working for Citi, focused in the competitive department of sales. There, she thrived, consistently ranking among the top 25 salespeople on site, receiving national recognition.</p>

<p class="intoTextPara2 pt-1">As the turn of the 2008 financial crisis started to change the credit industry, Nycole was invited to join Fidelity Investments as they opened a new operational site opening in Albuquerque. During her tenure with Fidelity she became a subject matter expert specializing in health and welfare operations and record management for other 3rd party clients. She assisted with systems design as new processing systems were created to streamline operations. In total, Nycole spent over 11 years working at the firm becoming a true expert in her field.</p>

<p class="intoTextPara3 pt-1">After leaving Fidelity, Nycole decided to embark on a new adventure with a complete career change by joining the first cohort of the Internet of Things Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp provided by CNM Ingenuity. This challenging hands-on bootcamp is designed to teach the basics of coding and electric/mechanical engineering within a 10 week period. However the camp was modified when the world went into lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Nycole not only took on the challenge but excelled with the changing environment. She spent the next couple of years gaining experience in fabrication, vinyl applications, metal and  woodworking. Once that experience was complete she decided to rejoin the Deep Dive Coding community, this time enrolling in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp to gain new knowledge and deepen her coding skills.</p>
